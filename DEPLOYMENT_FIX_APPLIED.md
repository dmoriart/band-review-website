# 🔧 Critical Deployment Fix Applied

## ✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

**Root Cause Found**: Database name mismatch in Render configuration
- `render.yaml` was referencing `band-review-db` 
- But the actual database was named `bandvenuereview-db`
- This prevented the deployment from connecting to the database properly

## 🛠️ FIX APPLIED

**Commit**: `d2574e7` - "Fix Render database configuration mismatch"
- Fixed database name from `band-review-db` to `bandvenuereview-db` in render.yaml
- This was preventing deployment from accessing the correct database
- Should resolve the deployment issue where API was stuck at version 1.0.0

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOME

Once Render processes this fix (typically 5-15 minutes), you should see:

1. **API Version Update**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://band-review-website.onrender.com/api/health
   # Should return: "version": "1.0.3"
   ```

2. **Merchandise Endpoints Available**:
   ```bash
   curl https://band-review-website.onrender.com/api/products
   # Should return: Product data with 3 sample products
   ```

3. **Store Page Functional**:
   - Visit: https://bandvenuereview.netlify.app/store
   - Should display the merchandise store with products
