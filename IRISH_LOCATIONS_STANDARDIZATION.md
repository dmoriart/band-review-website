# Irish Locations Standardization Summary

## Overview
All three scrapers (bands, studios, and venues) now use a **standardized, comprehensive list** of Irish locations covering all 32 counties and 391+ cities/towns across Ireland.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Created Centralized Location Reference** (`irish_locations.py`)
- **32 Counties**: All counties in Republic of Ireland + Northern Ireland
- **391 Cities/Towns**: From major cities (Dublin, Cork, Belfast) to small towns
- **56 Search Areas**: Optimized for Google Places API with coordinates and radius
- **426 Location Filters**: Lowercase list for band filtering

### 2. **Updated Studio Scraper** (`studio_scraper.py`)
**Before**: 20 cities (Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Galway, Limerick, Waterford, etc.)
**After**: 56 search areas covering all major population centers across Ireland

**Changes Made**:
- Import standardized location functions
- Replace hardcoded city list with comprehensive search areas
- Use coordinate-based search for better Google API coverage

### 3. **Updated Venues Scraper** (`irish_venues_scraper.py`)
**Before**: 13 search areas (major cities only)
**After**: 56 search areas covering all regions

**Changes Made**:
- Import standardized location functions
- Replace hardcoded search areas with comprehensive list
- Update city extraction to use full Irish cities list (391 vs 32)
- Update county extraction to use all 32 counties

### 4. **Updated Bands Scraper** (`irish_bands_scraper.py`)
**Before**: 23 location indicators for filtering Irish bands
**After**: 426 location indicators (all counties + cities + common terms)

**Changes Made**:
- Import standardized location list
- Replace hardcoded location list with comprehensive filtering

## Geographic Coverage

- **Northern Ireland**: Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry/Derry, Tyrone

### **Major Search Areas** (56 total)
Organized by radius based on population and importance:
- **25km radius**: Dublin (capital region)
- **20km radius**: Cork, Belfast (major cities)
- **15km radius**: Galway, Limerick, Waterford (large cities)
- **10-12km radius**: County towns and regional centers
- **6-8km radius**: Smaller towns and coastal areas

## Benefits

### **For Venues Scraper**
- **356% increase** in search coverage (13 → 56 areas)
- Better coverage of rural music venues
- More accurate county/city extraction

### **For Studios Scraper**  
- **280% increase** in search coverage (20 → 56 areas)
- Coverage of regional recording facilities
- Better representation outside major cities

### **For Bands Scraper**
- **1852% increase** in location filtering (23 → 426 terms)
- More accurate identification of Irish bands
- Better geographic tagging of band origins

## Technical Implementation

### **Consistent Imports**
All scrapers now import from the same source:
```python
from irish_locations import (
    get_all_irish_counties,
    get_all_irish_cities_and_towns, 
    get_search_areas_with_coordinates,
    get_irish_locations_list
)
```

### **Google API Optimization**
Search areas include optimal radius sizes for Google Places API:
- Prevents duplicate results from overlapping searches
- Ensures comprehensive coverage without gaps
- Balances API efficiency with thoroughness

### **Future-Proof**
- Single source of truth for Irish locations
- Easy to update all scrapers by modifying one file
- Scalable for adding new locations or regions

## Impact on Data Quality

### **Studios**: Expect to find recording facilities in:
- Rural areas previously missed (Connemara, Ring of Kerry, Donegal)
- Regional centers (Athlone, Carrick-on-Shannon, Letterkenny)
- Northern Ireland comprehensively covered

### **Venues**: Expect to discover:
- Festival venues in rural areas
- Community halls and cultural centers
- Coastal venues (West Cork, Wild Atlantic Way)
- Border region venues

### **Bands**: Better identification of bands from:
- All 32 counties now properly recognized
- Small town and rural band origins
- Cross-border collaborations (North/South)

This standardization ensures all three scrapers work with the same comprehensive understanding of Irish geography, leading to more complete and consistent data collection across your music platform.
